# Contributing

We :heart: contributions! We are excited to have your help building the EPFL
Startpage.

If you want to ask a question, leave remarks or comments, request a feature,
report a bug, please open an [issue]. Before you file your issue, search to
see if it has already been reported and check if it is not already answered in
the [README] or [DEVELOPMENT] documents. Be sure to be very clear, beacuse it's
likely that without a reproduction, contributors won't look into fixing your
issue and it will end up being closed.

## Pull Request Process

(WIP)

<!--
1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the
   layer when doing a build.
2. Please use the [WordPress Coding Standards], there is some support for that
   in the [Makefile](./Makefile), i.e. run `make phpcs`.
3. Update the [README.md] with details of changes to the interface, this
   includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and
   container parameters.
4. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the [README.md] to the
   new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we
   use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other
   developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the
   second reviewer to merge it for you.
